Here's a `README.md` file focusing on the context setup for the Counter component, explaining what each file does and why we structured it this way.

# Counter Context

This section of the codebase handles global state management for a simple counter using React's Context API and `useReducer` hook. The Counter context allows any component within the `CounterProvider` to access and modify the counter state (`count`). This approach centralizes state management for the counter, making it more scalable and easier to manage in larger applications.

## Folder Structure

```
src/
├── context/
│   ├── CounterContext.ts        # Defines the Counter context object
│   ├── CounterProvider.tsx       # Defines the Provider component and custom hook
```

## Files and Their Roles

### 1. `CounterContext.ts`

This file is solely responsible for creating the Counter context. 

- **Purpose**: By isolating the `CounterContext` object in its own file, we keep the context creation and usage separate, which improves modularity and eliminates Fast Refresh warnings in development.
- **Content**: 
  - Defines the `CounterContextType` interface, which specifies the shape of the context value.
  - Exports `CounterContext`, created with an initial `undefined` value to enforce that components using it are wrapped by a provider.

**Code Example**:
```typescript
import { createContext } from 'react';

interface CounterContextType {
  state: { count: number };
  dispatch: React.Dispatch<{ type: 'increment' | 'decrement' | 'reset' }>;
}

export const CounterContext = createContext<CounterContextType | undefined>(undefined);
```

### 2. `CounterProvider.tsx`

This file contains the `CounterProvider` component and the `useCounter` custom hook.

- **Purpose**: It wraps children components in a provider that gives them access to the counter state and dispatch function. By using `useReducer`, it also manages the counter's state updates in a functional, predictable way.
- **Content**:
  - **`CounterProvider`**: A wrapper component that initializes the counter state and reducer, passing the current `state` and `dispatch` function to the `CounterContext.Provider`.
  - **`useCounter`**: A custom hook that provides an easy way for components to access the context. If used outside of `CounterProvider`, it throws an error to ensure correct usage.

**Code Example**:
```typescript
import React, { useReducer, ReactNode } from 'react';
import { CounterContext } from './CounterContext';

interface CounterState {
  count: number;
}

type CounterAction = { type: 'increment' } | { type: 'decrement' } | { type: 'reset' };

const initialState: CounterState = { count: 0 };

function counterReducer(state: CounterState, action: CounterAction): CounterState {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    case 'reset':
      return initialState;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

interface CounterProviderProps {
  children: ReactNode;
}

export const CounterProvider: React.FC<CounterProviderProps> = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, initialState);

  return (
    <CounterContext.Provider value={{ state, dispatch }}>
      {children}
    </CounterContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useCounter = () => {
  const context = React.useContext(CounterContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error("useCounter must be used within a CounterProvider");
  }
  return context;
};
```

### Why We Structured It This Way

1. **Separation of Concerns**: By splitting `CounterContext` and `CounterProvider` into separate files, we improve code readability and maintainability. Each file has a specific responsibility: `CounterContext.ts` defines the context, while `CounterProvider.tsx` handles state logic and context access.

2. **Eliminates Fast Refresh Warnings**: React's Fast Refresh requires that files only export components or hooks. By moving `CounterContext` into its own file, we prevent the warning that would otherwise appear in development.

3. **Reusability and Scalability**: This approach makes it easy to expand our context if we want to add more features or state variables to the counter. The `CounterProvider` component can be imported wherever we need to provide counter state, and `useCounter` can be used within components to access the state and dispatch actions.

## Usage

1. **Wrap Application with `CounterProvider`**:
   Wrap your app or a section of it with `CounterProvider` to provide access to the counter state and actions.

   ```tsx
   import { CounterProvider } from './context/CounterProvider';

   function App() {
     return (
       <CounterProvider>
         <YourComponent />
       </CounterProvider>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Access State and Dispatch in Components**:
   Use the `useCounter` hook to access the `count` state and `dispatch` actions within any component inside `CounterProvider`.

   ```tsx
   import { useCounter } from './context/CounterProvider';

   function YourComponent() {
     const { state, dispatch } = useCounter();

     return (
       <div>
         <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
         <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>Increment</button>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

This structure offers a clean, modular setup for managing shared state in React applications using the Context API and `useReducer`. It helps maintain a single source of truth for the counter, making it easier to debug and reason about state changes.
